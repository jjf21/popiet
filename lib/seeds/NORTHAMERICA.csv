The beach is rocky until you hit the sand bar, which can vary in size depending on the current water level. On some days its as big as a football field, other days its gone completely. Some days even the rocky beach is missing. On the days when the sand bar is underwater some choose to rig on the rocky area and walk out or launch from there. Beware launching from the rocky beach as the wind is very shifty, and the water is shallow. It's best to rig your kite up and walk out past the rocky area to where the sand bar would be and launch there. If the sand bar is big enough for you to rig on it, then rig there and get someone to launch you. The sand bar is usually very busy and has limited space, so don't linger with your gear strewn out everywhere.
