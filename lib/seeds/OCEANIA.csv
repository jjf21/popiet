This the most upwind point in the bay. Launching anywhere east of the lifesaving club buildings is not advisable as it is almost impossible to sail upwind through the shore break here. Please do NOT attempt to launch down at the east end of the beach by the airport. The beach is long and sandy but can be very narrow at high tide, so launching is recommended at low tide. A main road runs adjacent to the beach and not only does it have the usual power lines but also has high voltage bus power cables too. Launching in the corner can be gusty. Definitely not a place for the novice! The beach gets very crowded in summer in sea breeze conditions. Please do the locals a favor and don't go out on those days.","https://www.windfinder.com/wind-cgi/homepagestatistics.pl?STATIONSNR=nz2","[{:month=>1, :stat=>72}, {:month=>2, :stat=>68}, {:month=>3, :stat=>69}, {:month=>4, :stat=>65}, {:month=>5, :stat=>66}, {:month=>6, :stat=>64}, {:month=>7, :stat=>62}, {:month=>8, :stat=>59}, {:month=>9, :stat=>72}, {:month=>10, :stat=>75}, {:month=>11, :stat=>77}, {:month=>12, :stat=>70}]"
